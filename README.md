# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

------------------------
### About the TSP
Travelling salesman problem (**TSP**) has been already mentioned in one of the previous chapters. To repeat it, there are cities and given distances between them.Travelling salesman has to visit all of them, but he does not to travel very much. Task is to find a sequence of cities to minimize travelled distance. In other words, find a minimal Hamiltonian tour in a complete graph of N nodes.
